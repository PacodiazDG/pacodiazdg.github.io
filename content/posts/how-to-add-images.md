Adding images to your Hugo posts is simple using Markdown.

### Embedding an Image

You can embed an image like this:

`![Alt text for the image](/images/my-awesome-image.jpg)`

Make sure your image files are located in the `/static/images/` folder (or wherever you prefer to store static assets).

### Image with a Caption

Some themes might support captions. Check your theme's documentation!
